    <h2>Your Name and Totoro</h2>
        <p>My two favourites anime movies. The story, the images.. all are beautiful.</p>
    <h2>Mad Max: Furry Road</h2>
        <p>I mean.. Have you watched it? The desert scenes are beautiful so bright with strong colors. <br>
           Beautiful to watch</p>
    <h2>Harry Potter (all of them)</h2>
        <p>They may not be the best movies but as a fan of the book series <br>
